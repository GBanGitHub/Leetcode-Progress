Easy
Topics: Binary Tree, DFS

Key Takeaways
- We can use DFS to find the deepest 
- You can use a helper function to add each layer that was searched using DFS

Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n)
    - This is because of the DFS
Space Complexity: O(n)
    - For the recursive function that helps adds each layer of DFS
