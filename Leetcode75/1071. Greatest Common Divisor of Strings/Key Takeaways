Easy (but this should be a medium at least ong)
Topics: Math, Strings, Recursive

Key Takeaways
- By using the communicative property. We can check to see if str1 and str2 are equal based off. If not you can just return an empty string
A = S^n
B = S^m
(n and m being lengths of strings)
A + B  =  S ^(n+m) = B + A
- If they are equal based off ^^^ then you can return str1 (or str2 cause they're the same)
- If they are not equal you can recursively check for gcd after checking for str1 (or str2) first. 
        - In python, "str1[len(str2):]" assuming that all conditions above are met ^^^ then str2 becomes removed from str1
        - self.gcdOfStrings would then recursively follow the statement above ^^^
- Make sure to create the same statement above ^^^ to meet if the conditions are reversed (str2 > str1)
