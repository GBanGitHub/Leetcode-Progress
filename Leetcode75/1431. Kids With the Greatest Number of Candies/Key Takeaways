Easy
Topics: Array

Key Takeaways
- Checking through the array and subtracting the extraCandies from the maximum will be more efficient
    - This logic is allowed because we are only comparing the max value of the array rather than each individual candy piece.
      If we were to compare each piece of candy then the code block becomes much bigger and more inefficient
- Using the logic above ^^^ the code will be easier to read and maintain

Time Complexity: O(n)
