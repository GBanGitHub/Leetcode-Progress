Topics: Array, Prefix Sum

Key Takeaways
- We can create two arrays, prefix and suffix, to traverse the array above and then split it into two
- The first loop will do the reverse multiplication and with the answer will move towards the second loop
- The second loop will stray away from nums[j] in order to not count it towards the final answer.


Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
    - If there is extra space then it would be O(1)
