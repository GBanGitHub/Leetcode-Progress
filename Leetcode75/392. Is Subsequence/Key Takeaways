Key Takeaways
- Given two strings (s and t for example)  you have to check if they are subsequent of each other (check if s is subsequent of t for example)
- For example
    - The string s is abc
    - The string b is afbgc
    - The string s is subsequent because if we get rid of the letters f and g, the string b becomes equal to string s as abc = abc
