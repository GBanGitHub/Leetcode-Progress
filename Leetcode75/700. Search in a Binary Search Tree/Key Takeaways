Topics: BST, Trees, Binary Trees

Key Takeaways
-Remember the important property of BST which is
    - Each node in the tree has a key which is greater than all the keys in the left subtree and smaller than those in the right subtree
-This problem can use a iterative approach in order to improve efficiency
    - Also Python does not support tail recursion optimization which can cause problems with memory usage
